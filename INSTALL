Quick start guide.
==================

CTS: Cluster Test System
The CTS uses a test driver node(TDN) to drive the execution of the test
software.  The CTS also uses 2 or more test target nodes(TTN) to run the test
cases.  The CTS software requires atleast 3 nodes 1 of which acts as a TDN and
the remaining acting as TTNs.

The dependencies of the TDN include Pacemaker and Augeas.

On the single TDN, it is recommended at this time to install pacemaker from
source so that the CTS from Pacemaker remains compatible with the current
working version of the CTS components within Corosync (currently you will
the devel branch http://hg.clusterlabs.org/pacemaker/devel/).

2] ssh access
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CTS requires login-less root access to the CNs.
so if my CN is called "node32"
# ssh node32
should not ask for a password and result in a root shell.

To enable this behavior, create a ssh key with the command ssh-keygen.  When it
prompts for a password, enter an empty field.  It will create a file called
~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub.  Copy that file to the TTNs into /root/.ssh/authorized_keys.
Ensure permissions are 700 on /root/.ssh.

Test ssh into the machine works without a password from the TDN.

3] Install augeas on the TDN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
yum install augeas

4] Configuring corosync for CTSs testing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

./configure --enable-testagents --enable-augeas --enable-debug

and then install it on the TTN.

5] run CTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cd <your-corosync-src-dir>/cts
sudo ./corolab.py --nodes "n1 n2 n3"
